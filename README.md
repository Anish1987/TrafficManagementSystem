# Traffic Management System

The Smart Traffic Management System is designed to create an advanced traffic control solution utilizing computer vision, machine learning, and optimization algorithms. The system is composed of three core modules: Vehicle Detection, Signal Switching Algorithm, and Visualization.

## Features

- Real-time vehicle detection using YOLO.
- Dynamic adjustment of traffic signal timings based on traffic conditions.
- Graphical visualization of traffic signal switching process using Pygame.
- Optimized traffic flow, reduced congestion, and minimized waiting times at intersections.
- Built using Python, OpenCV, Pygame, and YOLO for vehicle detection.
